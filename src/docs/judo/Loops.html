<strong>Loops are like conditionals, except they run over and over again.</strong>
<p>
A loop runs the code that is inside its curly-braces over and over, until its condition
is no longer true.  The most basic loop is a <strong><code>while</code> loop</strong>.<p>

The basic form of a while loop is this:
<code>
<pre>
while (condition) {
   // code to run each loop
}
</pre>
</code>

The (condition) above is just like a condition from the if/else conditionals.  Here is 
and example:
<code>
<pre>
int x;
x = 0;
while (x &lt; 10) {
   printLine("x is still less than ten");
   x = x + 1;
}
printLine("x is now equal to ten");
</pre>
</code>
The above loop will run ten times.  The first time through, x is equal to 0.  Is 0 less than 10?
Yes.  So the body of the loop (the printLine statement) is run.  We set the new value of x
to the old value of x plus 1, which is 0 + 1, so after the first loop, x is 1.
<p>
The next time through the loop it checks, Is x &lt; 10?  Yes it still is because 1 is less than 10.
It prints the line, and sets x equal to its old value plus one, or 1 + 1.  So x is now 2.
It checks again, is 2 less than 10.  Yes.  This keeps happening until x changes from 9 to 10.
Then next time the condition is checked, it asks, Is 10 &lt; 10.  No 10 is not less than 10 (its 
equal to 10).  So the loop stops running and it runs the printLine statement that says
"x is now equal to ten".

<p>
Here is a while loop example that uses the graphics function <code>drawString</code>.  The
program first asks the user their name, and then draws a String with their name in it in
growing letters.
<code>
<pre>
void main() {
   int size;
   String name; 
   setColor(blue);    

   printLine("Please enter your name.");
   name = readString();
   size = 5; 

   // while the size of the font is less than 200,
   // draw the message with bigger and bigger letters
   while (size &lt; 200) {
      clearDrawing();
      drawString("Hello, " + name, size, 10, 200);
      size = size + 10;
      delay(.1);
   }
   printLine("Done.");
}
</pre>
</code>
Be sure to set your program properties to "Text and Graphics" before running this
program, because it uses both text input/output and graphics.
