<strong>All computer programs have some way to give and/or receive information from the user.</strong>  When you type a paper in a word processor or enter numbers in a spreadsheet, you are giving the program information.
<p>
When you go to a website using a program called a web browser, the data and information is the text and images of the webpage.
<p>
<strong>Output</strong> is when a program gives the user data or information.<br>
<strong>Input</strong> is when a program receives data or information from the user.
<p>
In JUDO, you give the user output by using the following functions:<br>
<code>print()<br>
printLine()</code>
<p>
To receive input from the user, use these functions:<br>
<code>
readString()<br>
readInt()<br>
readDouble()<br>
readBoolean()<br>
readColor()
</code>
<p>
Here is an example programs using some of the above functions:
<code>
<pre>
void main() {
   String name;
   int age;
   
   printLine("Type your name and press enter");
   name = readString();
   
   printLine("Hello " + name + ".  Now enter your age");
   age = readInt();
   
   printLine(name + " you are " + age + " years old");
}
</pre>
</code>
<br>
<code>readString()</code> is used to assign a String value to a String variable.<br>
<code>readInt()</code> is used to assign an int value to an int variable.
<p>
<code>printLine()</code> prints the value or variable you put between the parenthesis and goes onto a new line<br>
<code>print()</code> prints the value or variable you put between the parenthesis and does not go onto a new line.

<p>
In the program above, you can see that Strings can be joined with String variables or
other types of variables to
make a longer string by using a plus sign (+).  This is useful when you want to print
something out to the user that includes the value of a variable.

<p>Making a graphics program like you have already seen how to do is another example
of a program that does output.  The output is the shapes and colors that you display 
to the user.

You can view the <a href="JUDOAppAPI.html#io">Input/Output functions in the JUDO
Functions Reference</a>.
