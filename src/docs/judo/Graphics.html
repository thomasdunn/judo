<strong>Graphical programs are Fun!</strong>
<p>
Writing a program with graphics means that it puts shapes and colors on the screen.
You could write a program that draws a clown face, or a pattern of colorful rectangles.
Or you could write a program that bounces a ball around the screen.
<p>
If you put the command <code>fillCircle(50, 70, 40);</code> in a program, it will draw
a circle 50 points (or pixels) away from the left edge of the screen, 70 pixels down from
the top of the screen, and the circle will have a radius of 40 pixels.
<p>
If you set the color before you call <code>drawCircle</code> using the command
<code>setColor(purple);</code> it will draw a purple circle.
<p>
As you can see from the example, you specify where a shape should go by specifying how far over from
the left edge of the screen and how far down from the top edge of the screen it is.
<p>
You can also have your program set what the color of its background should be by using the command
<code>setBackgroundColor</code>.  If you want to set the background to yellow, put the call 
<code>setBackgroundColor(yellow);</code> in your program.
<p>
The difference between <code>drawCircle</code> and <code>fillCircle</code>, and between any of the <code>draw</code> and <code>fill</code> 
functions, is that <code>draw</code> just paints an outline of the shape while <code>fill</code> fills the whole shape in.
<p>
Below is a sample program using what we have learned.  Type it into JUDO and compare what pops up
on the screen with what your code says.
<code>
<pre>
void main() {
   setBackgroundColor(yellow);

   setColor(purple);
   fillCircle(50, 70, 40);

   setColor(red);
   drawRectangle(60, 90, 70, 290);

   setColor(pink);
   fillRectangle(70, 250, 250, 100);
}
</pre>
</code>

<p>
The above program produces this output:<br>

<p>
Something you may want to do is add delays to your program.  Say in between drawing a couple
of lines or rectangles you want your program to wait for half a second, you can call
the <code>delay(0.5)</code>.  When you call <code>delay</code> you should use a <code>double</code> value representing
how many seconds you want the program to wait before going on.
