<strong>To use JUDO, there are five things you need to know how to do:</strong> Writing and Running programs, Creating new programs, Saving programs, Opening programs, and Setting program properties.

<p>
<font size="+1"><u>Writing and Running programs</u></font>
<blockquote>
To write a program, you need to click in the large white part of the JUDO window.  When you do
that, you will have a blinking cursor and you should type in your program.  When you are done
writing the program, press the "Run" button that is above where you type your program.<p>
After you press the run button, your program will pop up on the screen if there were no errors.
But if your program did have errors, they will appear in the little white area at the bottom
of the JUDO window.  You should read the error messages, fix the errors in your program,
and then hit the Run button again.
</blockquote>

<p>
<font size="+1"><u>Creating new programs</u></font>
<blockquote>
To create a new program, click on the "File" menu at the top-left part of the JUDO window
and then click on "New".  This will clear the area where you write your program so you can
start writing a new one.
</blockquote>

<p>
<font size="+1"><u>Saving programs</u></font>
<blockquote>
To save a program, click on the "File" menu, and then click "Save".  A box will pop up asking
you to give a name for your program.  Type in a name that describes your program, and then
click the "Save" button.  If you want to save onto a floppy disk so you can take your program
with you, use "Save to Floppy" on the "File" menu instead of "Save".
</blockquote>

<p>
<font size="+1"><u>Opening programs</u></font>
<blockquote>
To open a program, click on the "File" menu, and then click "Open Program...".
A box will pop up saying to choose a program to open.  There will be a box with an arrow
at the right edge.  Click the box and choose which program you want to open, and then click
the "OK" button.  To open a program off of a floppy disk, use "Open Program From Floppy..." on 
the "File" menu instead of "Open Program...".
</blockquote>

<p>
To get a feel for JUDO, you can try out some of the programs that come with it.
As described above, try opening a file.  You will see that there are already some
programs there for you to open.  Open one and run it.  See what happens.  You can
compare what the program that pops up does to the programs code.
<br>After you have done this, you are ready to start learning Java and writing your
own programs by looking through the tutorials.
