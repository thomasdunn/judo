JUDO Overview
=============

JUDO is a program written to help people learn to program,
pure and simple.  It is free software and you are encouraged
to give it to others, look at its source code, or improve it.
It is currently of beta quality.

JUDO was developed on the Windows platform, but care was
taken to make it cross-platform.  However, I have not tested
it, or even installed it all platforms.

I created JUDO while I was teaching a programming class to
12-14 year olds in Boston, MA.  The program I did this with
is called Citizen Schools (http://www.citizenschools.org/)
and I recommend that you check it out.

This installation of JUDO may include a copy of the Java
Development Kit from Sun Microsystems, Inc.  It is governed
by Sun Microsystems, Inc. Binary Code License Agreement.
